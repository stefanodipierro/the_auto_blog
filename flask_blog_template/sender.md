The Sender class is initialized with a params parameter that defaults to 'app/main/sender_params.json'. The sender_initializer method is then called.

In the sender_initializer method, the params file is opened and its JSON contents are loaded. The contents are then assigned to various instance variables.

In the send method, a header dictionary is created with the authorization key set to the instance variable self.authorization. The prompt is then cleaned and formatted.

A payload dictionary is created, containing the necessary parameters for the Discord API request.

A POST request is made to the Discord API with the payload and header data. If the response status code is not 204, indicating a successful operation with no return data, the request is repeated.

Finally, a success message is printed to the console.

In summary, this script contains a class Sender that's designed to send messages (or "prompts") to a Discord channel using the Discord API. The class reads configuration parameters from a JSON file, cleans up and formats the prompt, and sends it as a POST request to the Discord API. If the request isn't initially successful, it repeats the request until it is.
