The script starts by importing necessary modules:

requests: A Python library used for making HTTP requests.
json: A standard Python library used for handling JSON data.
time: A standard Python library used for time-related tasks.
PIL: Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.
os: A standard Python library used for interacting with the operating system.
datetime: A standard Python library used for dealing with dates and times.
re: A standard Python library used for working with regular expressions.

The Receiver class is initialized with a params parameter that defaults to 'app/main/sender_params.json', and a directory parameter that defaults to None. The sender_initializer method is then called.

In the sender_initializer method, the params file is opened and its JSON contents are loaded. The contents are then assigned to various instance variables.

In the normalize_prompt method, the prompt is cleaned by replacing all non-alphanumeric characters with nothing (effectively removing them), and then converted to lowercase.

In the retrieve_messages method, a GET request is made to the Discord API to retrieve the most recent message in the channel specified by self.channelid. The response is parsed from JSON format and the first message is returned.

In the collecting_result method, the image_prompt is normalized using the normalize_prompt method.

The method then enters an infinite loop, repeatedly retrieving the most recent message until it finds a suitable one.

A suitable message is defined as one that is from the 'Midjourney Bot', contains '**' in the content, and has an attachment that is a PNG image or contains '(Open on website for full quality)' in the content. If the normalized prompt in the message matches normalized_image_prompt, the URL and filename of the attachment are returned.

The split_image method opens the image file specified by image_file, splits it into four equal parts, and returns the four parts.

The download_image method sends a GET request to the specified url to download an image. If the request is successful (HTTP status code 200), it checks if the output and input folders exist and creates them if necessary.

The image content is then written to a file in the input folder. If the filename does not contain "UPSCALED_", the image is split into four equal parts using the split_image method, and each part is saved as a separate image in the output folder. The file paths of the output images are stored in the file_paths list.

If the filename does contain "UPSCALED_", the image file is moved from the input folder to the output folder without splitting it. The input image file is then deleted. Finally, the file_paths list is returned.

This class is primarily designed to interact with Discord's API, retrieve and process images from messages, and store the processed images to a specified directory.

As with any code, you should be careful when using this class. It contains an infinite loop (while True:) that could potentially run forever if not properly managed. It also downloads and processes image files, which can consume significant storage and processing resources. Ensure that you have the necessary resources and proper error handling in place before running this code.
