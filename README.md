Flask Blog Generator
Flask Blog Generator is a Python-based application that uses the power of AI to generate and populate a blog with posts. This application uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate blog post titles and content. It also interacts with Discord's API via the Midjourney bot to generate and manage images for the blog posts.

Features
User registration and login.
Dynamic generation of blog post content, including titles, article text, and images.
Customization of blog content generation based on user input.
Image management, including downloading, splitting, and saving images for blog posts.
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

You have installed Python 3.8 or later.
You have a basic understanding of Flask and Python.
You have API keys for OpenAI and Discord.
Installation
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy code
git clone 
cd flask-blog-generator
Install Python packages:
create .env file with your tokens

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

arduino
Copy code
python run.py
Usage
Here are the routes you can navigate to:

/register: Register a new account. The account information will be saved in the database.
/login: Login to your account.
/creator: Select the number of articles and the topic of the articles to be generated.
Please note that the application interacts with OpenAI and Discord APIs, and therefore requires proper API keys for these services. Make sure to provide these in the appropriate configuration files before running the application.

The /creator route presents a form that allows you to specify the number of articles and the topic for the blog posts. After submitting the form, the application will generate the specified number of articles on the given topic.

The text for the articles is generated by the GPT-3 model from OpenAI, and the images are created via the Midjourney bot on Discord. Each image is then downloaded, split into four parts (since Midjourney generates a grid or collage of four different images), and saved for the corresponding blog post.

As an important note, it is recommended to keep the request for article generation under 25 to avoid potential errors or issues.
You need to use your own discord details for sender_params.json and your own openai api.
